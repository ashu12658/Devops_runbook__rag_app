🚀 DevOps Runbook RAG Agent

A production-focused Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application that helps engineers troubleshoot DevOps and infrastructure issues using internal runbooks (PDFs).

The system generates strictly context-grounded answers from runbooks, reducing hallucinations and making it suitable for real-world DevOps and SRE workflows.

🧠 Problem Statement

In real DevOps environments:

Runbooks exist as long PDFs
Manual searching during incidents is slow
Generic AI tools may guess or hallucinate
Production systems require documented, reliable answers

This project turns static DevOps runbooks into a safe, queryable AI troubleshooting assistant.

✅ What This Project Solves
🔍 Instant semantic search across DevOps runbook PDFs
📄 Answers only from approved documentation
🛑 Prevents unsupported or guessed responses
🧩 Step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
⚙️ Production-aligned DevOps support tool
🧩 Architecture Overview
User sends a query
FastAPI /ask endpoint receives the request
Vector similarity search over runbook embeddings
Relevant runbook chunks are retrieved
LLM generates a response strictly from retrieved context
Fallback message if the answer is not found
🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI
Frontend: React
LLM: Groq (ChatGroq)
Framework: LangChain
Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Vector Store: In-memory vector store

⚙️ How It Works
Loads DevOps runbook PDFs at application startup
Splits documents into manageable chunks
Generates embeddings for semantic search
Retrieves relevant runbook sections
Generates answers strictly from retrieved content
🔐 Safety & Reliability
❌ No external knowledge usage
❌ No guessing or unsupported answers
✅ Strict context-based responses
✅ Clear fallback if answer is not in the runbook

Example fallback:

"This issue is not covered in the current runbook."
🔌 API Endpoints
Health Check
GET /

Response:

{ "status": "running" }
Ask a Question
POST /ask

Request:

{ "query": "server is slow" }

Response (example):

{
  "question": "server is too slow",
  "answer": "See Chapter 2: Why Is the Server So Slow?... (runbook-based response)"
}
🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategy
Senior DevOps / SRE tone
Step-by-step troubleshooting format
Actionable remediation steps
Explicit instruction to avoid external knowledge
Fallback when context is missing
⚙️ Run Locally
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashu12658/Devops_runbook__rag_app.git
cd Devops_runbook__rag_app
2️⃣ Backend setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingfacehub_api_key_here

Run backend:

uvicorn app:app --reload

👉 Backend runs on: http://localhost:8000

3️⃣ Frontend setup
cd rag-frontend
npm install
npm start

👉 Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000

🔗 Frontend–Backend Integration

Frontend communicates with backend via:

POST http://localhost:8000/ask

If needed, enable CORS in app.py.
